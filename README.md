# Exercise: Boolean Operators 1
Try to solve on paper the following boolean algebra operations:
* [A]: `2 <= 2 && !true`
* [B]: `!false && 3 > 2`
* [C]: considering that `t=false` and `f=true`: `!(!t || f)`
* [D]: `6 > 6 ^ !(true && true)`

Then compare your solutions with a Java program that tests the validity of your assumptions.
